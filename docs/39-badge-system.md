# 39 — Badge System

> Admin-assigned badges that shine on the leaderboard — a 7-day spotlight for exceptional contributors.

## Overview

Badges are admin-created awards assigned to users. Unlike achievements (computed from data) or tier badges (computed from tokens), these are **manual, ephemeral rewards** that celebrate specific contributions or behaviors.

### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | Design |
|--------|--------|
| Creation | Admin-only, via `/admin/badges` |
| Assignment | Admin assigns badge to user, visible on leaderboard within 1-3 min (cache TTL) |
| Duration | 7 days from assignment, auto-expires |
| Visibility | Leaderboard (public users only), profile popup/page (same access as profile) |
| Stacking | User can have multiple active badges (one per badge definition) |
| Re-assignment | Admin can re-assign same badge after current assignment expires or is revoked |
| History | All assignments preserved with full snapshot for audit |

### User Stories

1. **Admin creates badge**: "I want to create a badge with 1-3 characters that represents a specific honor"
2. **Admin assigns badge**: "I want to award this badge to a user for their contribution"
3. **User sees badge**: "I see my badge on the leaderboard instead of my rank number"
4. **Viewer sees badge**: "I see other users' badges in their profile popup (if I have access to view their profile)"
5. **Auto-expiry**: "Badge disappears after 7 days without manual intervention"
6. **Admin re-assigns**: "I want to give the same badge again after it expired or was revoked"
7. **Admin revokes badge**: "I want to immediately remove a badge with audit trail"

## Database Schema

### New Tables

### Schema Notes

- **Badge definitions are immutable once created** — no PATCH/DELETE endpoints; typos require archive + recreate
- **`is_archived`** hides badge from assignment UI but preserves renderability for historical assignments
- **Snapshot fields** (`snapshot_*`) capture badge appearance at assignment time for audit fidelity
- **`revoked_at/by/reason`** only set by manual admin revocation, never by system
- **`expires_at`** computed at assignment time: `datetime(assigned_at, '+7 days')`

### Assignment States

An assignment has exactly one of four states, **determined at read time**:

| State | Condition | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Active** | `revoked_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now` | Visible on leaderboard/profile |
| **Expired** | `revoked_at IS NULL AND expires_at <= now` | Naturally ended, not yet cleared |
| **Revoked (early)** | `revoked_at IS NOT NULL AND revoked_at <= expires_at` | Admin terminated before expiry |
| **Revoked (post-expiry)** | `revoked_at IS NOT NULL AND revoked_at > expires_at` | Admin cleared after natural expiry (for re-assignment) |

```typescript
type AssignmentStatus = 'active' | 'expired' | 'revoked_early' | 'revoked_post_expiry';

function deriveStatus(assignment: BadgeAssignment, now: Date): AssignmentStatus {
  if (assignment.revoked_at) {
    const revokedAt = new Date(assignment.revoked_at);
    const expiresAt = new Date(assignment.expires_at);
    return revokedAt <= expiresAt ? 'revoked_early' : 'revoked_post_expiry';
  }
  if (new Date(assignment.expires_at) <= now) return 'expired';
  return 'active';
}
```

**Audit semantics**:
- `expired` = badge ran its full 7-day course, no admin intervention
- `revoked_early` = admin terminated the badge before it would have expired
- `revoked_post_expiry` = badge expired naturally, then admin cleared it to allow re-assignment

This preserves full audit fidelity: you can always tell whether a badge completed its natural lifecycle.

### Unique Active Assignment (Database-Level)

The partial unique index `WHERE revoked_at IS NULL` prevents multiple non-revoked assignments of the same badge to the same user. This covers:
- **Active** assignments (should never duplicate)
- **Expired but not revoked** assignments (blocks new assignment until cleared)

**Re-assignment after expiry**: Admin must revoke the expired assignment first, then create a new one:
1. Admin sees expired assignment in list
2. Admin clicks "Clear for re-assignment" (or "Revoke" — same action)
3. System sets `revoked_at = now`, `revoked_by = admin`, `revoke_reason` (optional)
4. Since `revoked_at > expires_at`, status becomes `revoked_post_expiry`
5. Admin can now assign the same badge again

**API behavior for POST `/api/admin/badges/assignments`**:
- Check for existing non-revoked row for (badge_id, user_id)
- If found → 409 Conflict ("non-revoked assignment exists; revoke it first")
- If no non-revoked row → INSERT succeeds

### Active Badge Query

```sql
-- Get user's active badges (for leaderboard/profile)
-- Uses snapshot fields for rendering (audit-safe)
SELECT 
  ba.id,
  ba.snapshot_text AS text,
  ba.snapshot_shape AS shape,
  ba.snapshot_bg AS color_bg,
  ba.snapshot_fg AS color_text,
  ba.assigned_at,
  ba.expires_at
FROM badge_assignments ba
WHERE ba.user_id = ?
  AND ba.revoked_at IS NULL
  AND ba.expires_at > datetime('now')
ORDER BY ba.assigned_at DESC;
```

## Badge Visual Design

### Shapes (5 presets)

```
Shield        Star          Hexagon       Circle        Diamond
  ___        *   *           ____           ___          /\
 /   \        \ /           /    \         /   \        /  \
|     |    *--   --*       /      \       |     |      <    >
|     |        |          |        |       \   /        \  /
 \___/        / \          \      /         ---          \/
              *             \____/
```

SVG components with consistent viewBox, badge text centered.

### Color Palettes (6 presets, randomly selected)

| Name | Background | Text | Use Case |
|------|------------|------|----------|
| Ocean | `#3B82F6` (blue-500) | `#FFFFFF` | General |
| Forest | `#22C55E` (green-500) | `#FFFFFF` | Growth |
| Sunset | `#F97316` (orange-500) | `#FFFFFF` | Energy |
| Royal | `#8B5CF6` (violet-500) | `#FFFFFF` | Premium |
| Crimson | `#EF4444` (red-500) | `#FFFFFF` | Urgent |
| Gold | `#EAB308` (yellow-500) | `#1F2937` | Champion |

All colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.

### Text Rules

- **Length**: 1-3 characters only (enforced in API + UI)
- **Font**: System UI bold, centered in shape
- **Size**: Responsive based on character count (1 char = larger, 3 chars = smaller)

### Badge Component

```tsx
// packages/web/src/components/badges/badge-icon.tsx

type BadgeShape = 'shield' | 'star' | 'hexagon' | 'circle' | 'diamond';

interface BadgeIconProps {
  text: string;           // 1-3 chars
  shape: BadgeShape;
  colorBg: string;        // hex
  colorText: string;      // hex
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
}
```

## UI Integration

### 1. Leaderboard Row (Rank Position)

**Current**: `rank-badge.tsx` shows Trophy/Medal/Award icons for top 3, numbers for 4+.

**With badges**: If user has active badge(s), show **first badge** instead of rank indicator.

```
Before:                          After (with badge):
┌────┬────────┬──────────┐      ┌────┬────────┬──────────┐
│ 🏆 │ Alice  │ 1.2M     │      │ 🛡️ │ Alice  │ 1.2M     │
│ 🥈 │ Bob    │ 900K     │  →   │MVP │ Bob    │ 900K     │
│ 🥉 │ Carol  │ 800K     │      │ 🥉 │ Carol  │ 800K     │
│ 4  │ Dave   │ 700K     │      │ ⭐ │ Dave   │ 700K     │
└────┴────────┴──────────┘      │ S1│        │          │
                                └────┴────────┴──────────┘
```

**Logic priority**:
1. If user has active badge → show badge icon
2. Else if rank 1-3 → show trophy/medal/award icon
3. Else → show rank number

### 2. Profile Popup (Avatar Area)

**Location**: `profile-content.tsx`, next to avatar/name header.

**Display**: All active badges shown horizontally, size `sm`.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌────┐                         │
│  │    │  Bob Chen    MVP  ⭐     │
│  │ 🧑 │  @bobchen    ───  ──    │
│  └────┘              (badges)   │
│                                 │
│  Stats / Charts / etc.          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. User Profile Page

If dedicated profile pages exist (e.g., `/u/[slug]`), badges appear in same avatar-adjacent position.

## Admin Interface

### Badge Management Page (`/admin/badges`)

Two tabs:

#### Tab 1: Badge Definitions

| Preview | Text | Shape | Colors | Status | Actions |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| 🛡️MVP | MVP | Shield | Ocean | Active | [Archive] |
| ⭐神 | 神 | Star | Gold | Active | [Archive] |
| ⬡S1 | S1 | Hexagon | Royal | Archived | [Unarchive] |

**Note**: Badges are immutable once created — no edit/delete. Typos require archive + recreate.

#### Tab 2: Assignments

| Badge | User | Status | Assigned | Expires/Ended | By | Actions |
|-------|------|--------|----------|---------------|-----|---------|
| 🛡️MVP | Bob Chen | Active | 2026-04-10 | 2026-04-17 | admin | [Revoke] |
| ⭐神 | Alice Wong | Revoked (early) | 2026-04-08 | 2026-04-09 | admin | — |
| ⬡S1 | Carol Lee | Expired | 2026-04-01 | 2026-04-08 | admin | [Clear] |
| 🔷X | Dave Kim | Cleared | 2026-03-20 | 2026-03-27 | admin | — |

Filter options: All / Active / Expired / Revoked / Cleared

**Status legend**:
- **Active**: Currently visible on leaderboard
- **Expired**: Ran full 7 days, not yet cleared (blocks re-assignment)
- **Revoked (early)**: Admin terminated before expiry
- **Cleared** (or "Revoked post-expiry"): Admin cleared after expiry to allow re-assignment

### Create Badge Dialog

Fields:
- **Text** (1-3 chars, required)
- **Shape** (radio: Shield / Star / Hexagon / Circle / Diamond) + [Randomize]
- **Color** (radio: Ocean / Forest / Sunset / Royal / Crimson / Gold) + [Randomize]
- **Description** (optional admin notes)
- **Preview** (live render of badge)

### Assign Badge Dialog

Fields:
- **Badge** (dropdown of active badges only)
- **User** (search with autocomplete)
- **Note** (optional reason for assignment)
- **Duration**: 7 days (fixed, shown as info)
- **Expires**: computed date shown

**Validation**: API rejects if user has any non-revoked assignment (active OR expired) of this badge. Admin must clear/revoke first.

### Revoke / Clear Badge Dialog

Fields:
- **Reason** (optional text explaining action)
- **Confirmation** checkbox

Records `revoked_at`, `revoked_by`, `revoke_reason` for audit. Same action for both "Revoke" (active) and "Clear" (expired).

## API Routes

### Badge Definition

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/admin/badges` | List all badge definitions (include archived) |
| POST | `/api/admin/badges` | Create badge definition |
| POST | `/api/admin/badges/[id]/archive` | Archive badge (hide from assignment UI) |
| POST | `/api/admin/badges/[id]/unarchive` | Unarchive badge |

**No PATCH/DELETE** — badges are immutable once created to preserve assignment history integrity.

### Badge Assignment

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/admin/badges/assignments` | List all assignments (filterable: active/expired/revoked/cleared/all) |
| POST | `/api/admin/badges/assignments` | Assign badge to user (rejects if any non-revoked assignment exists) |
| POST | `/api/admin/badges/assignments/[id]/revoke` | Revoke or clear assignment (sets revoked_at/by/reason) |

### Public Badge Query

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/users/[slug]/badges` | Get user's active badges |

**Privacy**: Uses the same `canBypassPublic()` logic as `/api/users/[slug]`:
- Public users (`is_public=1`): accessible to anyone
- Private users (`is_public=0`): accessible only to admin, teammate, or same-season participant

This ensures badge visibility matches profile visibility — if someone can see a private user's profile popup, they can also see their badges. No "badge-shaped hole" in authorized views.

### Leaderboard Integration

The existing leaderboard API (`/api/leaderboard`) will be extended to include active badges in the response:

```typescript
interface LeaderboardEntry {
  // ... existing fields
  badges?: Array<{
    id: string;
    text: string;
    shape: BadgeShape;
    colorBg: string;
    colorText: string;
  }>;
}
```

**Cache behavior**: Leaderboard uses `s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=120`. Badge changes (assign/revoke/expire) will be visible within **1-3 minutes** on the main leaderboard. This is acceptable — badges are not time-critical. The admin UI and profile popup (no cache) show immediate state.

## Worker-Read RPC

Add new RPC handlers in `packages/worker-read`:

```typescript
// badges.get — get active badges for user(s)
// badges.list — admin: list all definitions
// badges.assignments — admin: list assignments with filters
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Database migration (`0XX-badges.sql`)
2. Worker-read RPC handlers
3. Badge icon component (`badge-icon.tsx`)
4. Type definitions in `@pew/core`

### Phase 2: Admin Interface

1. `/admin/badges` page with tabs (Definitions / Assignments)
2. Create badge dialog (no edit — badges are immutable)
3. Assign badge dialog with user search + duplicate check
4. Assignment list with revoke action + status filters

### Phase 3: Public Display

1. Leaderboard integration (replace rank with badge)
2. Profile popup badge display
3. Profile page badge display (if applicable)

### Phase 4: Polish

1. Badge assignment notifications (optional)
2. Badge history view for users (optional)
3. Expired badge indicators (optional)

## Security Considerations

- All badge management routes require admin auth
- Badge text sanitized (1-3 chars, alphanumeric + limited unicode)
- No HTML/script injection in badge text or description
- Rate limiting on assignment API to prevent spam
- Badge query uses `canBypassPublic()` — same access control as profile route

## Future Considerations

- **Custom duration**: Let admin specify expiry (1-30 days)
- **Badge categories**: Group badges by purpose (season awards, achievements, special events)
- **User-visible history**: "Past badges" section in profile
- **Notifications**: Email/in-app when badge assigned
- **Badge reactions**: Users can react to others' badges

## Decision Log

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 7-day fixed expiry | Simple UX, creates urgency, encourages re-engagement |
| 2 | Replace rank (not overlay) | Clean visual, rank can be inferred from position |
| 3 | First badge wins on leaderboard | Avoid visual clutter, most recent assignment shown |
| 4 | All badges shown in profile | Profile has more space, users want to show off |
| 5 | Snapshot badge appearance in assignment | Audit fidelity — historical assignments show exact appearance at assignment time |
| 6 | Badges immutable once created | Simplifies state machine; typos fixed via archive + recreate |
| 7 | Four-state model (active/expired/revoked_early/revoked_post_expiry) | Distinguishes natural expiry from admin revoke, and early termination from post-expiry clearing |
| 8 | DB-level unique constraint on non-revoked assignments | Prevents race conditions on concurrent assign requests |
| 9 | Badge API uses `canBypassPublic()` like profile route | Ensures badge visibility matches profile visibility — no "badge-shaped hole" |
| 10 | 1-3 min leaderboard visibility SLA | Badges aren't time-critical; admin UI shows immediate state |

---

## Test Matrix

### Privacy Tests

| Scenario | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| GET badges for public user (no auth) | 200 + badge array |
| GET badges for private user (no auth) | 404 |
| GET badges for private user (as admin) | 200 + badge array |
| GET badges for private user (as teammate) | 200 + badge array |
| GET badges for private user (same season) | 200 + badge array |
| GET badges for private user (unrelated authed user) | 404 |
| Leaderboard only contains public users | Private users excluded entirely; badges only for public users |

### Assignment Uniqueness Tests

| Scenario | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| Assign badge A to user X (no existing non-revoked) | 201, assignment created |
| Assign badge A to user X (active exists) | 409 Conflict |
| Assign badge A to user X (expired but not revoked) | 409 Conflict |
| Assign badge A to user X (previous revoked/cleared) | 201, new assignment created |
| Two concurrent POST for same badge+user | One succeeds, one fails with UNIQUE constraint (DB-level) |

### Status Derivation Tests

| Scenario | revoked_at | expires_at vs now | Status |
|----------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Active badge | NULL | future | `active` |
| Naturally expired, not cleared | NULL | past | `expired` |
| Admin revoked while active | <= expires_at | N/A | `revoked_early` |
| Admin cleared after expiry | > expires_at | N/A | `revoked_post_expiry` |

**Audit fidelity**: `revoked_post_expiry` indicates the badge completed its full lifecycle before being cleared for re-assignment.

### Badge Immutability Tests

| Scenario | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| POST `/api/admin/badges` | 201, badge created |
| PATCH `/api/admin/badges/[id]` | 404 or 405 (no such route) |
| DELETE `/api/admin/badges/[id]` | 404 or 405 (no such route) |
| POST `/api/admin/badges/[id]/archive` | 200, is_archived=1 |
| Archived badge still renders in historical assignments | snapshot_* fields used, renders correctly |

### Leaderboard Cache Tests

SLA: Badge changes visible on main leaderboard within **1-3 minutes** (s-maxage=60 + stale-while-revalidate=120).

| Scenario | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| Assign badge, check admin UI | Immediate visibility |
| Assign badge, check leaderboard | Visible within 1-3 min |
| Revoke badge, check admin UI | Immediate removal |
| Revoke badge, check leaderboard | Removed within 1-3 min |
| Badge expires naturally | Removed on next leaderboard refresh after expiry |

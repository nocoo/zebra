# Autoresearch Ideas Backlog

## UT speed/stability/meaningfulness session (2026-04-21)

### Wins (committed)
- [x] **Restrict `test.include` glob** to `packages/*/src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` + `scripts/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` — vitest no longer scans `dist/`, `.next/`, `node_modules/` at startup. 4.30s → 4.14s (-3.7%).
- [x] **`coverage.include` = `.ts` only** (drop `.tsx` since all tsx files are in coverage.exclude anyway) — reduces v8 instrumentation discovery. 4.14s → 4.02s (-2.9%) AND stddev 0.10 → 0.04 (-58%) — dual win on speed and stability.
- [x] **Drop `json` coverage reporter** — no consumers in repo (grep verified). 4.02s → 3.92s (-2.5%).
- [x] **Exclude `**/__tests__/**` from coverage** — test helpers (`test-utils.ts`) no longer dilute coverage stats. Pure meaningfulness fix; speed unchanged.

### Net session result
- Cold UT (low load): **4.30s → 3.92s (-8.8%)**
- Stddev: **0.10s → 0.04s (-58% — major stability win)**
- Coverage: maintained at 98.05/92.20/98.31/98.97 (stmts/branches/funcs/lines)
  - 3 of 4 floors well above 95; **branches 92.20 < 95** is a structural gap, not a regression.


### Confirmed dead ends (this session)
- [x] `pool: "vmThreads"` — crashes (incompatible with mocking patterns).
- [x] `pool: "forks"` — 2x slower (process startup overhead).
- [x] `poolOptions.threads.useAtomics: true` — 2x slower in vitest 3.x.
- [x] `poolOptions.threads.minThreads/maxThreads: 8/12` — slower than default 15.
- [x] `coverage.experimentalAstAwareRemapping: false` — faster but artificially inflates coverage (98.05→99.04, 92.2→94.13). **Rejected as cheating** — less accurate source mapping should not be used to chase the 95% floor.
- [x] `isolate: false` — fails (achievements-privacy.test.ts state leakage); 66 files use vi.mock, refactor too invasive.
- [x] Drop html reporter — within noise.
- [x] `coverage.cleanOnRerun: false` — within noise.
- [x] `coverage.processingConcurrency: 16` — within noise.

### Still worth trying (not done — load was too noisy)
- [ ] Identify the file(s) leaking module state under `isolate: false` and fix (potentially huge speedup if isolation can be disabled). Confirmed pollution surface: `achievements-privacy.test.ts` failures point at vi.mock('@/lib/db') collisions across 66 files.
- [ ] Strengthen weak assertions (`toBeDefined()`, `toBeTruthy()` without value checks) — top offenders: sync.test.ts (19), user-achievements-api.test.ts (12), achievements-api.test.ts (11). Pure meaningfulness improvement, no speed effect.
- [ ] Investigate the 5 `it.skipIf(!!process.env.CI)` tests in sync.test.ts/hermes-sqlite.test.ts/notify-command.test.ts — all rely on real-FS inode behavior. Refactor with mocked `fs.stat` to remove CI skip and increase meaningful test count from 3659 → 3664.
- [ ] Push branch coverage above 95 (currently 92.20). Top low-branch files: cli/commands/session-sync.ts (71), api/admin/check (60), api/achievements (73). Add tests for error/edge paths.
- [ ] esbuild target tuning (`esbuild.target: "esnext"`) — tested under load, no clear effect; retry under quiet system.
- [ ] Pre-bundle heavy deps via `server.deps.optimizer` / `optimizeDeps`.
- [ ] Switch primary metric to `min` of N runs (not median) — more robust against background load on dev machines.

## Pre-commit Performance Optimization (prior session)

### Completed ✅ — overlaps all three processes
- [x] Skip bun install --frozen-lockfile when no package.json/bun.lock changes staged — saves ~0.2s on most commits
- [x] Enable vitest caching in node_modules/.cache/vitest — reduces variance
- [x] Parallel tsc via bash script with proper exit code handling — typecheck dropped from ~4s to ~1.3s
- [x] **Pre-commit fast-path for docs-only commits** — 5.5s → 0.3s (17x) when no .ts/.tsx/.js/.json staged
- [x] **Parallel pre-push (E2E + G2 security)** — saves max(E2E,G2) instead of sum
- [x] **Parallel osv-scanner + gitleaks within G2** — small win, gitleaks=50ms
- [x] **Cache osv-scanner by bun.lock hash** — G2 3.5s → 0.15s when deps unchanged
- [x] **Cache L1 vitest by .ts/.tsx + vitest-version hash** — 5s → 0.04s when nothing relevant changed
- [x] **Cache G1a typecheck by .ts/.tsx + tsconfig + tsc-version hash** — 1.3s → 0.04s when cached

## Attempted but Not Viable ❌
- [x] Enable incremental tsc for cli/worker/worker-read — lockfile overhead negates typecheck gains
- [x] Limit vitest threads to 4-8 — doubled test time due to pool contention
- [x] Remove json+html coverage reporters — no measurable improvement, high variance
- [x] Text-only coverage reporter — actually slower than text+json+html (5.5s vs 4.8s)
- [x] Parallel tsc using & wait in npm script — doesn't propagate exit codes (typecheck passes with errors)
- [x] vitest --poolOptions.threads.isolate=false — 5 tests fail due to shared state

## Potential Future Optimizations (Not Yet Tried)

### Low Effort
- [ ] Use `vitest --reporter=basic` for CI output (less verbose)
- [ ] Move heavy test setup into shared fixtures to amortize "prepare" time across tests

### Medium Effort  
- [ ] Module mocking optimization — some tests import heavy modules
- [ ] Shared test fixtures — reduce per-test setup overhead for similar tests
- [ ] Pre-compute test data instead of generating inline
- [ ] Adopt tsgo (@typescript/native-preview) for typecheck once GA — ~10x faster but currently dev-preview only
- [ ] Switch coverage provider to istanbul if v8 v8 ESM remap continues to add transform overhead

### High Effort / Risky
- [ ] Test sharding across CI workers (for CI, not local dev)
- [ ] Lazy module imports in test files  
- [ ] Pre-compile test files to reduce transform time
- [ ] Disable vitest isolation per-file via opt-in tag (need to enumerate safe files)
- [ ] Replace vitest with bun:test for non-mocking-heavy unit tests

## Measurements Summary
| State | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Baseline (sequential, original) | ~8.0s |
| Parallel L1+G1a+G1b | ~4.9s |
| Combined pre-commit + G2 security baseline | ~9.1s |
| Cold pre-commit + G2 (with G2 cache populated) | ~4.5s |
| **Warm (all caches hit, no source changes)** | **~0.26s** |
| **Docs-only commit (early-exit)** | **~0.3s** |

**Total improvement: 35x faster on warm runs (9.1s → 0.26s)**

## Cache Architecture
All caches stored under `.git/info/` (gitignored, local-only):
- `g2-cache.json` — osv-scanner (key: SHA256(bun.lock) + tool version)
- `l1-cache.json` — vitest (key: SHA256(.ts/.tsx mtime+size) + vitest version)
- `g1a-cache.json` — tsc (key: SHA256(.ts/.tsx + tsconfig mtime+size) + tsc version)

Environment overrides: `PEW_G2_NO_CACHE=1`, `PEW_L1_NO_CACHE=1`, `PEW_G1A_NO_CACHE=1`.

## Notes
- Tests are highly parallelized (Duration < tests time due to parallel execution)
- collect time (~7.5s) is dominated by module loading — hard to optimize
- transform time (~4s) is esbuild, already very fast
- The main wins came from:
  1. Running independent tasks in parallel
  2. Skipping unnecessary checks (lockfile when no deps changed)
  3. Parallel TypeScript compilation across packages

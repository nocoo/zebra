# Changelog

## v1.4.0

### Features

- **Privacy policy page** — New `/privacy` page with Privacy icon (ShieldCheck) linked from landing, leaderboard, and dashboard
- **Enhanced project stats** — Projects API now returns `total_messages`, `total_duration`, and `models` arrays; responsive columns on projects table

- **formatDuration helper** — Human-readable duration formatting for session/project display

### Fixes

- **CLI no-subcommand usage** — Running `pew` without a subcommand now shows usage instead of citty's "No command specified" error

### UI

- **Unified public page styling** — Privacy ShieldCheck icon and `© {year} pew.md · Privacy` footer consistent across landing, leaderboard, and dashboard header

### Infrastructure

- **D1 migration 008** — Null out legacy unhashed `project_ref` values; re-sync repopulates with valid 16-char hex hashes

## v1.3.0

### Features

- **Team owner controls** — Member list view, kick members, rename team, leave guard for owners
- **Team logo upload** — R2-backed logo upload with unique keys, compensating R2 delete on DB failure, cache busting, and error state reset

### Fixes

- **Worker ON CONFLICT mismatch** — Redeployed Worker after migration 006 added `device_id` to UNIQUE constraint (was causing all token ingests to silently fail with 500)

### Infrastructure

- **npm keywords** — Added `openclaw`, `copilot`, `vscode-copilot` for discoverability
- **Documentation** — All tool lists updated to reflect 6 supported AI tools across CLAUDE.md, docs, and test assertions

- **Multi-device sync** — Added `device_id` column to usage records for per-device deduplication
- **Team member limit** — `app_settings` table with configurable `max_team_members` (default 5)

### Fixes

- **Team join race condition** — Atomic INSERT...SELECT prevents duplicate team memberships
- **Project alias deduplication** — PATCH projects deduplicates `add_aliases` to prevent UNIQUE constraint errors
- **Project rollback safety** — Rollback logic in projects API prevents partial updates; pre-existing aliases preserved during rollback
- **Admin settings validation** — `max_team_members` validated as positive integer
- **UI polish** — Unified lowercase "pew" brand with handwriting font, leaderboard z-index and font sizing fixes

### Infrastructure

- **D1 migration 006** — `device_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default'` on `usage_records` with updated UNIQUE constraint (5 columns)
- **Squashed schema sync** — `001-init.sql` updated with projects, device index, and renumbered migrations

## v1.1.1

### Fixes

- **Landing install command** — Changed from `bun add -g` to `npm install -g` for broader compatibility (CLI is pure Node.js, no Bun dependency required)
- **CLI login redirect** — Use `x-forwarded-host`/`x-forwarded-proto` headers for public origin instead of container-internal `request.url` (`0.0.0.0:8080` → `pew.md`)

### Infrastructure

- **D1 database ID** — Fixed Railway env var pointing to deleted D1 database
- **Retrospective** — Documented `request.url` internal hostname pitfall in CLAUDE.md

## v1.1.0

### Features

- **Public leaderboard overhaul** — Leaderboard moved out of dashboard layout into standalone public page with landing-page-style design (logo, GitHub link, theme toggle, fade-up animations)
- **Privacy toggle** — `is_public` column on users table; settings page toggle controls leaderboard visibility; public profiles gated by opt-in
- **Admin leaderboard mode** — Admin users see all users regardless of `is_public` status via scope dropdown (Global / Teams / All Users)
- **Sidebar external links** — Navigation items support `external?: boolean` flag, rendering as `<a target="_blank">` with ArrowUpRight icon
- **Leaderboard UI polish** — Period tabs (This Week / This Month / All Time), scope dropdown with Lucide icons (Globe / Users / ShieldCheck), check-style ruling on rows, handwriting font (`text-3xl`) for token numbers with full comma formatting

### Fixes

- **Login card clipping** — Auto-height fix prevents footer from clipping the login button
- **Admin fallback** — Admin bare endpoint returns `is_public: false` instead of `null`
- **Migration backfill** — Settings and leaderboard fallback for existing users without `is_public`
- **Smooth dashboard resize** — Dashboard resize and sidebar logo rendering improvements
- **Handwriting vertical alignment** — `leading-none` on `text-3xl` token numbers fixes baseline shift
- **Leaderboard skeleton flash** — `use-leaderboard` hook keeps stale data visible during refetch (`refreshing` state)

### Refactoring

- **Leaderboard layout** — Extracted from dashboard into `app/leaderboard/page.tsx` as standalone route
- **Default leaderboard limit** — Changed from 50 to 10

### Infrastructure

- **D1 migration** — `005-is-public.sql` adds `is_public INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` to users table
- **Squashed schema** — `001-init.sql` updated with `is_public` column
- **Test suite** — 1545 tests passing, proxy tests updated for `/leaderboard`, L1 tests for `is_public` settings and admin leaderboard

## v1.0.0

### Features

- **Achievement badge system** — 6 gamified badges (On Fire, Big Day, Power User, Big Spender, Veteran, Cache Master) with bronze/silver/gold/diamond tiers, progress rings, and pill card UI on the dashboard
- **Dashboard segments** — Dashboard restructured into 4 named sections (Achievements, Overview, Trends, Insights) with `DashboardSegment` dividers for clear visual hierarchy
- **Budget tracking** — Full budget lifecycle: set monthly token budgets via dialog, progress bar with threshold alerts, budget status API (GET/PUT/DELETE), and Clear Budget button
- **Time analysis** — Streak tracker (local timezone), peak hours detection, weekday vs weekend comparison chart with dual Y-axes, month-over-month growth metrics
- **Cost analytics** — Cost trend chart, cache savings estimation, monthly cost forecast, cost-per-token breakdown, and forecast stat card on dashboard
- **Cache & I/O visualization** — Cache rate chart showing daily hit rates, I/O ratio donut chart for input/output token balance
- **Tool comparison** — Source trend chart (agent usage over time), model evolution chart (model adoption timeline) on Models page
- **Landing page redesign** — Single-viewport layout with motion animations, streamlined CTA hierarchy, usage steps, theme toggle, and 512px logo

### Refactoring

- **Dashboard layout** — Two-column chart layout (trends left, donut/ratio right) with By Agent chart flex-stretching to fill container height; side-by-side bottom row (heatmap + weekday/weekend)
- **Stat card grid** — Consolidated into clean 4+4 (lg) or 4+2 (md) responsive grid layout
- **Achievement UI** — Redesigned from vertical cards to horizontal pill cards with tier-colored icons and compact progress rings; replaced InsightCards and StreakBadge
- **Apps → Agents** — Renamed "By App" to "By Agent" across navigation, routes, and UI labels
- **Landing page** — Stripped card grid, condensed feature descriptions, rebranded slogan to "show your tokens"

### Fixes

- **Budget scope** — Budget status now uses current-month tokens instead of period-scoped total
- **Streak timezone** — Streak "today" comparison uses local timezone instead of UTC
- **Weekday/weekend scale** — Added separate cost Y-axis for proper dual-axis scaling
- **Login page encoding** — Added `<meta charset="utf-8">` and replaced em dash with hyphen to fix character display
- **Proxy matcher** — Leaderboard filter dropdown uses Lucide ChevronDown with proper padding

### Infrastructure

- **Database rename** — Renamed `zebra-db` to `pew-db` with new APAC-region D1 instance
- **Migration squash** — Consolidated 5 migration files into single `001-init.sql` (9 tables, 8 indexes)
- **Test suite** — 50+ test files, 1508 tests passing, 90% coverage thresholds enforced

## v0.6.2

### Features

- **Notifier automation** — Added installable notifier drivers for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Codex, plus shared `notify.cjs`, coordinated `pew notify`, `pew init`, and `pew uninstall`
- **Notifier lifecycle visibility** — `pew status` now reports installed / not-installed / error notifier state per source

### Fixes

- **Coordinator runtime fallback** — `pew notify` now degrades safely when Bun runtime file handles do not expose `lock()`, avoiding crash-on-notify under Bun
- **OpenClaw trigger control** — Generated OpenClaw plugin now includes a 15s trigger throttle and better config/CLI error handling
- **Dry-run and uninstall safety** — `pew init --dry-run` no longer creates directories, and `pew uninstall` only removes generated `notify.cjs` files that match the pew marker

## v0.6.1

### Fixes

- **Version display** — CLI help text now correctly shows v0.6.1 (v0.6.0 was published with stale build artifacts showing v0.5.0)

## v0.6.0

### Features

- **Shared validation layer** — `@pew/core` upgraded from pure types to runtime package with shared constants (`SOURCES`, `MAX_INGEST_BATCH_SIZE`, `MAX_STRING_LENGTH`) and validation functions (`validateIngestRecord`, `validateSessionIngestRecord`) used by both Next.js API routes and Cloudflare Worker for defense-in-depth
- **Generic upload engine** — `createUploadEngine<T>()` factory with configurable preprocessing, retry, batching, and progress callbacks; eliminates duplicate upload logic between token and session pipelines

### Fixes

- **ISO date validation** — Added `$` anchor and semantic `Date.parse()` check; previously accepted trailing garbage like `2026-01-01T00:00:00Zfoo` and impossible timestamps like `9999-99-99T99:99:99`
- **Integer enforcement** — Token and message count fields now reject floats (e.g. `1.5` tokens)
- **String length limits** — Model, session_key, and other string fields capped at 1024 chars to prevent abuse
- **Byte offset queue reads** — `BaseQueue.readFromOffset()` uses `Buffer.subarray()` instead of `String.slice()`, fixing incorrect cursor advancement on non-ASCII content (e.g. CJK model names)
- **Corrupted JSONL handling** — Per-line `JSON.parse` error handling in queue reads; a single malformed line no longer blocks all subsequent uploads
- **429 double-sleep** — Rate-limit retry no longer sleeps twice (Retry-After sleep + exponential backoff); `sleptFor429` flag skips redundant backoff
- **Worker validation parity** — Worker now validates source enum, ISO date format, non-negative integers, and string lengths (previously accepted any values)

### Refactoring

- `createIngestHandler<T>()` factory reduces two Next.js ingest routes from 169+210 lines to 17+31 lines
- `BaseQueue<T>` generic class reduces two queue implementations from 84+77 lines to 13+13 lines
- Token upload (282→90 lines) and session upload (278→85 lines) rewritten as thin wrappers around upload engine
- Worker rewritten from 302 to 207 lines using `@pew/core` validators

### Infrastructure

- `@pew/core` now has runtime exports (constants + validation), remains zero external dependencies
- Test suite: 50 test files, 725 tests passing (+95 tests, +4 files vs v0.5.0)

## v0.5.0

### Features

- **Codex CLI support** — Full token and session parsing for OpenAI Codex CLI (`~/.codex/sessions/`); cumulative diff strategy with counter-reset detection, SHA-256 hashed projectRef for privacy, incremental byte-offset cursors, and `$CODEX_HOME` env var support
- **Session statistics** — End-to-end session tracking pipeline: per-tool collectors (Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Codex), session-sync orchestrator, session-upload with queue, `POST /api/ingest/sessions` and `GET /api/sessions` API routes, Sessions dashboard page with overview cards, activity heatmap, and message chart
- **OpenCode SQLite sync** — Enabled by default (feature flag removed); reads token usage directly from OpenCode's SQLite database for higher fidelity data

### Fixes

- **Status source classification** — Refactored `classifySource()` from substring matching to prefix matching using resolved source directories, correctly handling `$CODEX_HOME` and other env var overrides
- **Codex privacy** — Hash `cwd` path with SHA-256 (first 12 chars) for projectRef to prevent absolute path leakage in uploads
- **OpenCode SQLite dedup** — Watermark boundary dedup and silent skip for warnings during SQLite incremental reads

### Infrastructure

- Codex added to web validation, display labels (`SOURCE_LABELS`), and pricing defaults (`$2/$8/$0.50 per MTok`)
- D1 schema migration for `session_records` table
- Worker extended with session ingest handler and path routing
- Test suite: 46 test files, 630 tests passing

## v0.4.0

### Fixes

- **Token accounting** — Include `cached_input_tokens` in `total_tokens` computation; previously only summed `input + output + reasoning`, now correctly sums `input + cached + output + reasoning`

### Docs

- **Token accounting spec** — Added `docs/05-token-accounting.md` documenting per-source token field mappings, formulas, and billing semantics
- **Read-only constraint** — Codified raw data read-only rule in `CLAUDE.md` (never modify `~/.claude/`, `~/.gemini/`, etc.)

### Chores

- Added `sync` and `sync:prod` shortcut scripts to root `package.json`

## v0.3.0

### Features

- **Sidebar overhaul** — 3 collapsible NavGroups (Overview, Analytics, Account) using Radix Collapsible + CSS Grid animation; collapsed mode flattens to icon-only tooltipped buttons
- **Dashboard period selector** — "All Time / This Month / This Week" pill selector with dynamic stat cards and charts
- **Daily Usage page** — Usage trend chart, source + model filter dropdowns, monthly pagination with prev/next buttons
- **By Model page** — Added ModelBreakdownChart (horizontal stacked bar) above the detail table
- **`useUsageData` hook** — Now supports explicit `from`/`to` date params for flexible date range queries
- **D1 schema** — Added `nickname` column to `users`, created `teams` and `team_members` tables for upcoming team features

### Refactoring

- Renamed "Daily Details" → "Daily Usage" across sidebar and route labels
- Removed ModelBreakdownChart from dashboard (moved to dedicated By Model page)
- Sidebar rewritten from flat nav list to data-driven `NavGroup[]` architecture

### Infrastructure

- Test suite: 32 test files, 403 tests passing

## v0.2.0

### Breaking Changes

- **Project rename** — Renamed from "zebra" to "pew" across all packages, types, config paths, API key prefixes (`zk_` → `pk_`), and domains
- **CLI package** — Now published as `@nocoo/pew` (was `@nocoo/zebra`)
- **Config directory** — Moved from `~/.config/zebra/` to `~/.config/pew/`

### Features

- **Worker ingest** — Cloudflare Worker with native D1 bindings replaces REST API, reducing 60 sequential HTTP calls to a single batched request
- **CLI pre-aggregation** — Idempotent upload pipeline with multi-row INSERT and chunked batches (20 rows / 180 params)
- **429 retry** — CLI retries on rate limit with `Retry-After` header support
- **Dev mode** — `--dev` flag with separate `config.dev.json`, `DEFAULT_HOST`/`DEV_HOST` constants, and `resolveHost` helper
- **Sync improvements** — Files scanned per source in summary, directory-level mtime skip for OpenCode, batch size tuned to 50 for D1 Free plan limits
- **Logo assets** — Asset pipeline (`scripts/resize-logos.py`), file-based metadata icons, OpenGraph images in layout

### Fixes

- Exclude API routes from proxy matcher to allow Bearer token auth
- Pass env vars as Docker build args for Next.js page data collection
- Chunk ingest into 20-row batches to avoid D1 999-param limit
- Skip TLS verification in dev mode for mkcert certs

### Refactoring

- Remove standalone `upload` and `init` commands (merged into `sync`)
